Due to significant changes in the Forge ecosystem, our modloader support is strictly version-dependent:

- 📦 **Minecraft 1.20.1 and earlier**: Forge is supported
- 📦 **Minecraft 1.20.2 and newer**: Only NeoForge is supported (Forge is not compatible)

> ⚠️ **Important**: For Minecraft 1.20.4 and newer versions, we only support Fabric and NeoForge. Standard Forge is not supported and will not work with our platform.
